# Geometry
This is a basic geometry library for 2D and 3D shapes. It is written in c# and is intended to be used in game and simple math projects.
I would not reccomend it for any serious math projects as it is not optimized for precision, and primarily uses floats. That being said,
it is very fast and easy to use. It is also very easy to extend and add new shapes to the library.

One of the ongoing bits of work is to add test coverage to the library. There are proabably a number of bugs that have not been found yet,
and test coverage will help to find them. If you find a bug, please open an issue and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.

Note that some of the of the objects in this library are assumed to be grid-aligned (Rectangle, Cube). Further work could be done to make them more general.
